        There are two main data structures used to track a branch of a bidirectional BFS.

        Queue: this contains pages to be checked in the next iteration. Follows the following
        format:
            [(title, continueToken), ...]
        If the page to be checked still has links that have not yet been returned by the API,
        there will be a continue token in the response. We use that to get the next set of
        links.

        Cache: this tells us which pages have already been visited, as well as the parent/child
        relationships we need to calculate the path from the start point to the point of
        intersection. Follows the following format:
            {

                    'parent': None,
